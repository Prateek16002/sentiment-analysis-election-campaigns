# sentiment-analysis-election-campaigns
This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment expressed in political election campaigns using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging tools like Hugging Face Transformers and pre-trained sentiment models (e.g., DistilBERT), we classify text data into positive, neutral, or negative categories and visualize sentiment trends.
